# Personal Resume and Portfolio

Currently hosted on https://noelle.pavlovic.family

## Getting Started

Set your content for the various sections in `data.js` file and then:

`npm install`\
`npm start` 

Installs all of the dependencies and runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

## Custom Colour Reference

In addition to the default colours provided by TailWind CSS, I also defined the following additional colours (and related shades), which match the colour scheme used in my resume.

| Color          | Hex                                                                |

    title: COVID Assessment and Registration System
    customer: Rose City Gymnastics
    description: >-
      <p>During the COVID pandemic, Rose City Gymnastics was required to keep
      track and record of everyone who entered their facility (athletes,
      coaches, volunteers). Additionally, everyone entering the building was
      required to complete a daily attestation that they were not showing any
      COVID symptoms, nor that they were in contact with anyone who tested
      positive for COVID.</p> <p>Each morning, the system would email anyone who
      was scheduled to enter the facility with a unique link to their daily
      attestation form. Once the form is completed attesting that the person
      isn't showing any symptoms (ex: body temperature) and that they were not
      in contact with a known COVID case, they would be shown a notification
      that they were allowed to enter the facility on that day at their
      specified time. Alternatively, if they had symptoms, or contact, they
      would be notified to stay out of the facility.</p><p>Rose City Gymnastics
      staff had an easy-to-use Admin UI which would allow them to set training
      schedules for all of the athletes, coaches and volunteers (in order to
      comply with maximum facility occupancy regulations), as well as view
      reports for a particular day and time, in order to know who is allowed to
      enter the facility.</p>

    title: Student Information and E-Commerce System
    customer: Canterbury College
    description: >-
      <p>Canterbury College is a non-profit corporation that provides education
      and residence services for students. In addition, Canterbury College is
      also home to Canterbury ElderCollege, a program for students over the age
      of 55, designed to provide learning opportunities for older adults. This
      was a multi-year project with a number system add-ons, improvements, as
      well as a replatform due to a back-end end-of-life.</p><br /><h3
      class=text-white>ElderCollege Student Information System</h3><p>The
      ElderCollege Student Information System was the initial engagement. The
      system allowed for ElderCollege Students to easily register for accounts,
      register for available courses, and pay for them directly online using the
      e-commerce system (powered by GlobalPayments). The ElderCollege Admin UI
      was initially built using JQuery, and later refactored to use React as a
      single-page application (SPA). The Admin UI allowed for Canterbury College
      staff to manage course offerings (including pre-requisite and
      anti-requisite courses), course fees, student records and transcripts, as
      well as promotional pricing. Courses were offered on 2 campuses and are
      available in-person or online.</p><br /><h3 class="text-white">Canterbury
      College Residence</h3><p>Canterbury College offers a family residence for
      married students and students with children. Canterbury College offers two
      different type of accommodation: shared accommodation in 12 hourses
      featuring furnished single rooms, as well as 3 apartment buildings with a
      total of 76 apartments. The Residence Registration system allowed students
      to reserve their rooms or apartments on a monthly or per semester basis
      (depending on accommodation type) and pay for their rent online. The Admin
      UI allowed Canterbury College staff to easily manage and configure their
      settings for all buildings, rooms, prices, incidental fees, and payment
      records in a self-service manner.</p><br /><h3
      class="text-white">Canterbury College Parking</h3><p>Canterbury College
      also offers on-premise parking permits for their residents, as well as
      University of Windsor faculty and Staff. The Parking management system
      allowed for eligible campus community members to purchase their parking
      spots online. The Admin UI allowed Canterbury College staff to manage
      their lots, occupancy, and issue physical parking passes to their
      customers.</p><br /><h3 class="text-white">Special Events and
      Donations</h3><p>Canterbury College hosts a number of fundraising events
      through the year, some are hosted by special guests, while others are
      simply gala type events without a particular agenda. Additionally,
      Canterbury College wanted to give their patrons the ability to donate
      funds directly to the College online. The Special Events and Donations
      Admin UI allowed for staff to easily manage the various events, including
      capacity as well as tax receipts (where applicable) for donors.</p><br />
